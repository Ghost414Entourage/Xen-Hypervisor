Xen stands out as a powerful and mature open-source bare-metal (Type-1) hypervisor.

(Type-2) hypervisors that run on top of an existing operating system, Xen runs directly on the hardware, providing a thin layer that orchestrates the execution of multiple guest operating systems, known as virtual machines (VMs) or domains.
